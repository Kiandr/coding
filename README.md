In this repository, I implement and practice important data structure, and respond to questions such as Sorting, Searching, String manipulation, array and pointer management.

## ES6
In order to add ES6 syntax, add babel-preset-env into your parent directory.
Install `npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env`. 
Then create a new folder as:
`touch .babelrc` 
Finally add following into the file. 

    {
      "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
    }
